description : Today, I was testing this game in a Tablet and there was
 an error at the end of a level(just before displaying winning window).
 And i didn't find any way to look at exception stacktrace, so ACRA
 integration could be a way to know about these occurred exceptions.

 ACRA has couple of methods for sending these error logs, and Email
 method sounds quite simple and easy to configure, and good for start.
 One of disadvantages could be high number of emails in a case of
 having lots of users. I don't think we face this issue but if so, then
 other methods could be used in later versions.

story point : 0.2 = 0.2
