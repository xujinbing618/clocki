subject : Game score and one step back feature

description : After end of each level, if number of moves is less than last
 time, then we need to update highest score(which is lowest moves). For sake
 of simpilicity displaying this number next to the level name sounds enough.
 Changing background color(for example to Green) also is user-friendly way
 of showing to users that this level of puzzle is done.

 Another nice feature to have is, decreasing move count if any square backs to
 position that they came from last time. Let's call this, one-step-back feature.

story point : 0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6
